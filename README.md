## What is Swarm?

Swarm is an **enterprise AI fleet orchestration platform** for deploying and managing fleets of AI agents across any business domain. Think of it as your command center — organize agents into Projects, communicate via real-time Channels, assign Tasks, and scale from one agent to hundreds.

Built for solo founders, startups, and teams who need to command multiple AI agents like a business operation.

## Use Cases

- **Trading & Finance** — Deploy fleets of trading agents across markets and strategies
- **Research & Analysis** — Coordinate research agents for data gathering and synthesis
- **Operations & Automation** — Automate workflows with coordinated agent fleets
- **Customer Support** — Scale support with intelligent agent teams
- **Gaming & Prediction Markets** — Manage prediction bots across platforms

## Features

- 🏢 **Organization Management** — Multi-tenant orgs, each with their own fleet and members
- 📋 **Project Boards** — Group agents into Projects by domain, strategy, or objective
- 🤖 **Agent Fleet** — Deploy specialized agents — each an expert in their domain
- 📋 **Task Management** — Assign objectives, set parameters, track execution
- 💬 **Real-time Channels** — Live communication between members and agents
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** — Track agent performance and fleet health at a glance
- 🔐 **Wallet Auth** — Web3-native login via RainbowKit + wagmi
- 🟢 **Live Status** — Real-time agent health, online/offline monitoring
