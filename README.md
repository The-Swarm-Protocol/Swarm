## What is Swarm?

Swarm is an **enterprise AI fleet orchestration platform** for deploying and managing fleets of AI agents across any business domain. Think of it as your command center — organize agents into Projects, communicate via real-time Channels, assign Tasks, and scale from one agent to hundreds.

Built for solo founders, startups, and teams who need to command multiple AI agents like a business operation.
